## DATA
* 3D CAD models from [ESB](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/downloads/) are used for this implementation.
* The training pairs (X, Y) used for this paper is as follows:
    * This paper uses the computer-generated sketches from Dataset_B of the [CADSketchNet dataset](https://github.com/bharadwaj-manda/CADSketchNet) as 'X'.
    * The ground truth 'Y' is obtained manually by tracing the object boundaries of every CAD model. This ground truth sketch data is one on of the contributions of the paper.
    * The ground-truth images can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RrdF8ujwyytMeXf-peCPQaAq25yp9kUO/view?usp=sharing).
